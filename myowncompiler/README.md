Basic Java features to test
===
* compilation unit
* import statement
* package declaration
  * probably something with the module.exports thing
* type declaration
  * ClassDeclaration
    * once we know how to implement classes, it will be easier to define them
  * EnumDeclaration
    * maybe?
  * InterfaceDeclaration
    * probably not
  * AnnotationTypeDeclaration
    * definitely not



rt.jar
===
* How to handle imports?
* String
* ArrayList
* LinkedList
* HashMap

Other
===
* what to do with comments?
  * Can we just sort of put them in there?
* can probably just skip the visibility modifiers, right?
* need to include Test.main() at the bottom
* const / enum in javascript, maybe create it with the Java code to make the JS code

Stuff
===
* Recreate everything from scratch
  * Lots of refactoring to move all of the JS into one place
  * Browserify and other stuff like that
* editors, or at least a choice of the editor
* Put into the jspacco.github.io location, somehow. Not sure how to mix these together?
