/**
 * WorkThread class is responsible for placing the blocks into the Minecraft world.
 * The job of the WorkThread is to take a queued job from the WorkMap asynchronously and 
 * place the actual blocks into the Minecraft world.
 * 
 * The run() method takes work from the WorkMap and does it as quickly as it can.
 * Essentially, the method gets work from WorkMap then in the Synced Executor, places the blocks into the world.
 * Then, the thread sleeps for a specified amount of time before getting more work. This is in oder to give
 * the main Minecraft thread some time to catch up and not cause it to lag behind in ticks from giving it too 
 * much work to do all at once.
